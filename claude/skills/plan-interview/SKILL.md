# Plan Interview

Conduct in-depth technical interviews about project plans to deeply
understand implementation details, uncover hidden assumptions,
and identify potential issues before implementation begins.

**Language:** Match the user's input language.
Use explicitly requested language if specified.

## Workflow

### Step 1: Understand Input

Input: `$ARGUMENTS`

- **File path** (contains `/` or ends with `.md`, `.txt`)
  -> Read the file, use Glob for related files
- **Text description** -> Use directly as project concept

### Step 2: Assess Complexity

| Complexity | Indicators                           | Questions |
| ---------- | ------------------------------------ | --------- |
| Simple     | Single feature, clear scope          | 3-4       |
| Medium     | Multiple features, some integrations | 5-7       |
| Complex    | System-wide, many integrations       | 8-10      |

### Step 3: Conduct Interview

Use AskUserQuestion tool. Ask ONE question at a time.

For question areas,
see [references/interview-areas.md](references/interview-areas.md).

**Progress Tracking:** Display after each question:

```text
[Progress: 2/6 | Covered: Architecture, API | Remaining: Security, Testing]
```

**Guidelines:**

- Ask meaningful follow-up questions
- Dig deeper on vague answers
- Challenge assumptions respectfully
- Skip non-applicable areas

**Intermediate Save:** Every 3-4 questions,
save to `.interview-progress-<timestamp>.md`:

- Questions asked and responses
- Areas covered and remaining

**Completion:** Interview ends when:

1. All relevant areas covered, OR
2. Maximum questions (10) reached, OR
3. User requests to end

Before ending:
"I've covered [areas]. Anything else before writing the specification?"

### Step 4: Write Specification

Use template from [references/spec-template.md](references/spec-template.md).

**Output location:**

- File input -> Same directory with `-spec` suffix
- Text input -> Ask user, default `./specs/<project-name>-spec.md`

**Cleanup:** Delete `.interview-progress-*.md` after successful spec generation.

## Triggers

This skill activates when users want to:

- Be interviewed about a project plan or specification
- Uncover hidden assumptions in their implementation plan
- Get structured feedback on a project idea before coding
- Generate a detailed specification from a concept

## Anti-Patterns

- **Asking obvious questions**: Don't ask what's already in the plan
- **Rushing through areas**: Ensure clarity before moving on
- **Ignoring context**: Adapt questions to project type
- **Skipping confirmation**: Always confirm before ending

## Extension Points

1. **Custom interview areas**: Add domain-specific areas
   in references/interview-areas.md
2. **Template customization**: Modify spec template for organization standards

## Design Rationale

**Why dynamic question count?** Fixed counts don't fit all projects.
Simple features need fewer questions;
complex systems need thorough exploration.

**Why intermediate saves?** Long interviews risk context loss.
Periodic saves preserve progress and enable session recovery.

**Why separate references?** Keeps SKILL.md lean.
Question lists and templates are loaded only when needed.
